# Refactoring Exercises: Solutions and Explanations

This document provides an overview of the solutions and explanations for the refactoring exercises aimed at resolving violations of software design principles such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP). Each section corresponds to a specific exercise.

## Exercise 1: Refactoring to Follow the SRP

### Problem Statement
The original `Employee` class had multiple responsibilities, violating the SRP.

### Solution Overview
1. Identified the responsibilities of the `Employee` class.
2. Created separate classes (`EmployeeSalary`, `EmployeeReport`, `EmployeeNotification`) for each responsibility.
3. Ensured each class has a clear and well-defined responsibility.
4. Used appropriate naming conventions and interfaces to promote loose coupling.

### Code Changes
- Introduced separate classes for salary calculation, report generation, and notification handling.
- Used interfaces or abstractions to decouple classes and promote flexibility.

## Exercise 2: Refactoring to Follow the OCP

### Problem Statement
The original `PaymentProcessor` class violated the OCP by using a switch statement to handle different payment types.

### Solution Overview
1. Identified the varying and stable parts of the `PaymentProcessor` class.
2. Created an abstraction (`IPayment`) to represent different payment methods.
3. Created concrete implementations for each payment method.
4. Refactored the `PaymentProcessor` class to accept the abstraction instead of specific payment types.

### Code Changes
- Introduced an interface (`IPayment`) for payment methods.
- Created concrete implementations for each payment method.
- Used dependency injection to decouple the `PaymentProcessor` from payment method implementations.

## Exercise 3: Identifying and Resolving LSP Violations

### Problem Statement
The original class hierarchy for banking accounts violated the LSP, particularly in the `SavingsAccount` class.

### Solution Overview
1. Identified the LSP violation in the provided code.
2. Refactored the code to adhere to the LSP by ensuring that the `SavingsAccount` class correctly implements the behavior expected of an `Account`.

### Code Changes
- Introduced a common interface (`IBankAccountOperations`) for bank account operations.
- Adjusted method signatures and encapsulated fields to ensure adherence to LSP.

## Conclusion
These refactoring exercises demonstrate the importance of adhering to software design principles for maintainability, extensibility, and readability of code. By applying these principles and making appropriate design decisions, we can create software that is more flexible, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.
